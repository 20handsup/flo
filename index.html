        Nanci Griffith died on August 13 of 2021. I, like much of the world as
        I learned later, was totally shocked and saddened. I had become aware
        of Nanci Griffith from her recording of
        <em>From a Distance</em>. Even though it was a mega-hit for Bette
        Midler, I have always preferred Nanci&rsquo;s performance. As a regular
        viewer of the David Letterman shows, I also enjoyed her many
        appearances there as well. To my great regret, I never had the
        opportunity to attend one of her concerts.
      </p>

        According to Wikipedia, Nanci was born in Seguin but raised in Austin,
        Texas. She began her career performing in local coffeehouses in Austin at
        the age of 12. Her father took her to a Townes Van
        Zandt performance as a teenager. She would later record Van Zandt's
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc6AsDmuD2U&amp;ab_channel=MarkO%27Connor"><em>Tecumseh Valley</em></a>
        as a duet with Van Zandt. Of Van Zandt, Nanci said, “Without this
        man, who is the finest song-writer that the state of Texas ever gave
        birth to, there would be no Nanci Griffith.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Another good friend of Nanci was the great John Prine. Nanci recorded the John Prine 
        song:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOsqgbeEIhU&amp;ab_channel=derek868"><em>The Speed Of The Sound Of Loneliness</em></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        John&rsquo;s wife,
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JohnPrine/photos/a.10151864916729446/10159589657624446/?type=3">Fiona Whelan Prine</a>, wrote regarding Nanci&rsquo;s passing: “It 
        was never a secret that John loved to sing with women. He marveled at 
        how the best and beautiful voices in music agreed to sing with him and 
        especially at how good they made him sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nanci Griffith had one of those best and beautiful voices. She was
        maybe his first real duet partner on stage. I rode the tour bus in the
        early 1990s with them and it was a golden time. She and John had a
        real affection for each other; both enjoyed their Major cigarettes
        from Ireland; they had the same sense of goofy humor; and he regarded
        her as a kindred spirit because they both saw and wrote about the
        experiences of everyday men and women of the heartland.”

        Lyle Lovett met Nanci when he was a reporter for his college paper at
        Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, just up the road from
        Klein. According to a piece from the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JohnPrine/photos/a.10151864916729446/10159589657624446/?type=3">Washington
          Post</a>: “She invited him to perform at Anderson Fair, a popular
        songwriters&rsquo; haunt in Houston, where he fell in with the likes of Eric
        Taylor and Lucinda Williams. ‘That was a consistent quality about
        Nanci was quick to encourage younger performers. She extended
        herself,&rsquo; Lovett says. Griffith later invited him to Nashville to sing
        on her 1984 album <em>Once in a Very Blue Moon.</em>  In 1985 Nanci&rsquo;s first appearance on
        <a href="https://youtu.be/AysAB0fYOMs?si=gu_m27oPTjrw0Dcv&t=753">Austin City Limits</a>
        a very young Lyle can be seen singing backup for Nanci.

        After Nanci&rsquo;s passing, I
        found this video of youthful Lyle and Nanci performing at a Backyard BBQ in East Texas, singing a duet entitled
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY0AAVKIMPI"><em>Closing Time</em></a>.
